A/B Testing to Distinguish Impact of Version of Landing Page on User

In this project, A/B testing is performed on Udacity's Course dataset. It consists of 5 columns, <user_id, timestamp, group, landing_page, converted>. In A/B testing, we used 3 columns of out of them, group, landing_page, and converted.

We once simulated some experiments N times with respect to the conversion rates (control, treatment) already obtained over dataset. After got the further idea about dataset with this simulation, we supposed a null hypothesis and an alternative thesis. To claim our trueness of alternative hypothesis, we calculated z critical score by using Z test method with respect to alpha (0.05), and then we checked out beta, and power with respect to the effect size of the experiment.
